# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains my personal implementations of core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from scratch using Python. 

The purpose of this project is to build a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals, focusing on object-oriented design, memory management, and algorithm optimization (Time & Space Complexity).

## 📚 References & Study Materials

The implementations and concepts in this repository are based on the following excellent educational resources:

1. **[Data Structures in Python - Full Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBY_q7zw3qo)** by *NeuralNine*
   - Focuses on building fundamental data structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashmaps) from scratch using pure Python classes.
   
2. **[The Ultimate DSA Course for 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMeD8trbj6A)** by *Boot.dev*
   - Focuses on Big-O analysis, sorting algorithms, tree/graph traversals (BFS/DFS), and algorithmic problem-solving strategies.
